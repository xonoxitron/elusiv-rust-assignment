# Coding Challenges

## General Information

This repo contains coding challenges for applicants at Elusiv. The process for any assignment generally is a two step process, first you write your code as demanded by the assignment and later discuss it with Elusiv engineers. The code is evaluated on the following criteria, so keep these in mind when completing your assignment:


- Code Quality: Are there any obvious code smells? Think about keeping your code style fitting for the language, variable naming, simplicity, etc. .
- Maintainability: Is your code usable if passed on to another developer? Think about documentation, testing, error handling, etc.
- Correctness: Does your code do what is asked in the assignment? Note here - we value this more highly than completeness, so if faced with the choice of doing two features semi-correctly or one feature correctly, we prefer the latter (one feature correctly).

## FAQ

> Is scalability an evaluation criteria?

We obviously do not expect you to write carmack-esque levels of optimized code for a take home assignment, but an O(n!) solution is not great either. If your code runs fast for a reasonable input size, you're fine (what a "reasonable input size" is, is defined on a per-assignment basis in the assignment description). Bonus points if you can discuss optimization possibilities in the follow-on discussion.

> Am I allowed to use external libraries?

Yes, so long as they do not replace the bulk of the assignment. Remember, the point of this exercise is for you to show off your engineering skills. Use your best judgement here.
